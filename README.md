# FaceRecognition

A simple face recognition system built with Python and OpenCV. Detects and recognizes faces from images or live webcam feed using pretrained face embedding models and classification algorithms.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Face detection using Haar Cascades or DNN-based detectors  
- Face embedding generation with OpenFace / FaceNet / similar pretrained models  
- Face recognition by training classifiers (e.g. SVM, k-NN) on embeddings  
- Command-line and interactive mode for:
  - Generating face embeddings
  - Training recognition model
  - Testing recognition on images or webcam input  
- Modular design for easy retraining with new faces

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/niteshkumar956/FaceRecognition.git
   cd FaceRecognition
2. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment
```python3 -m venv venv`
source venv/bin/activate1```
3. On Windows: ``` venv\Scripts\activate```
#Install dependencies
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

🧠 Usage
1. Prepare data
   Place face images in ```data/raw/```, organizing each person's folder by name.
---
2. Generate embeddings
```python src/embed.py --input_dir data/raw --output_file data/embeddings/embeddings.pkl```
---
3. Train classifier
```python src/train.py --embeddings data/embeddings/embeddings.pkl --model_path models/recognition_model.pkl```
---
4. Recognize faces
Image file input
```python src/recognize.py --image path/to/test.jpg --model models/recognition_model.pkl```
Webcam input
```python src/recognize.py --webcam 0 --model models/recognition_model.pkl```
---
🧩 Dependencies
Listed in ```requirements.txt```.
-Core libraries include:
1.opencv-python
2.numpy
3.scikit-learn
4.face_recognition or tensorflow/keras (for embedding model)
5.Any additional supporting libraries
